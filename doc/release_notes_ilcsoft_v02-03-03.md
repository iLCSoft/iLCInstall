### podio v00-99 (v01-00 pre-release)

**This is a pre-release for the first stable release of podio.** We consider the file format as well as stable and also consider the base functionality to be in place. All additional functionality should be implementable on top of the existing file format as well as existing features. We will make a few smaller fixes and remove still existing deprecated functionality before we release v01-00 in the next few weeks.

Changes wrt v00-17-04

* 2024-02-06 tmadlener ([PR#554](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/554))

* 2023-09-05 Andre Sailer ([PR#223](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/223))
  - CI: use same lcg stacks as podio

* 2024-02-07 tmadlener ([PR#50](https://github.com/key4hep/k4edm4hep2lcioconv/pull/50))
  - Make it possible to keep working with MCParticle momenta based on floats for now. See https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/266

* 2024-02-07 tmadlener ([PR#45](https://github.com/key4hep/k4edm4hep2lcioconv/pull/45))
  - Make the upcoming renaming of `TrackerHit` -> `TrackerHit3D` transparent

* 2024-02-07 jmcarcell ([PR#48](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/48))
  - Delete build workflow since we have another one for key4hep that covers builds for nightlies, releases and all the operating systems we support

* 2024-02-07 jmcarcell ([PR#47](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/47))
  - Change ROOTFrame{Writer,Reader} to ROOT{Writer,Reader} following Remove the Frame from the default readers and writers following https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/549

* 2024-02-07 jmcarcell ([PR#46](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/46))
  - Fix compiler warnings related to double - float that appear after https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/237
  - Switch to non-deprecated name for `ROOTWriter` (https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/pull/549)

* 2023-11-30 tmadlener ([PR#42](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/42))
  - Add conversion of TrackerHitPlane from EDM4hep to LCIO.
    - NOTE: The covariance matrix is not set, because there is no public setter available to do so in LCIO.

* 2023-11-14 tmadlener ([PR#38](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/38))
  - Remove compatibility with all legacy versions of EDM4hep since #34 made the minimum version 0.10.1 in any case.

* 2023-11-08 jmcarcell ([PR#34](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/34))
  - Use the new `edm4hep::CellIDEncoding` for consistency. Needs https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/234

* 2023-11-06 tmadlener ([PR#36](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/36))
  - Make sure to convert the full content of `edm4hep::Clusters` to LCIO clusters, including `subdetectorEnergies` and the related calorimeter hits. Set the `contribution` 1.0 because that seems to be the only value in use.
  - Add tests that cover this part of the converter.

* 2023-10-19 jmcarcell ([PR#31](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/31))
  - Do not forward declare `podio::ObjectID` since this doesn't always build
  - Add a library alias for the `k4EDM4hep2LcioConv` target
  - Add `podio` to the list of required packages (it's already there in the spack recipe)

* 2023-10-05 tmadlener ([PR#29](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/29))
  - Add the existing EDM4hep to LCIO conversion tests from MarlinWrapper
  - Fix minor issues in conversion that were uncovered during this

* 2023-10-05 tmadlener ([PR#21](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/21))
  - Generalize the conversion functionality to make it possible to use "generic maps" (i.e. `vector<tuple<K, V>>` or a proper `map<K, V>`).
    - This makes most of the conversion a template (i.e. header) library.
    - Keep the current behavior by specifying suitable defaults for all the templates.
  - This is necessary to support the introduction of a shared global map in [key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper#147](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/147)

* 2023-10-04 tmadlener ([PR#28](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/28))
  - Add test setup to run the standalone converter on ILD REC and DST files with a comparison between the original and the converted file afterwards
  - Make sure to check relations in converted objects
  - Fix a bug in the relation resolution of the ReconstructedParticle that was uncovered.
  - Make `RelWithDebInfo` the default build type.

* 2023-09-12 tmadlener ([PR#27](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/27))
  - Introduce the `EDM4hep2LCIOConv` namespace for the EDM4hep to LCIO conversion functionality to avoid polluting the global namespace with too many (rather generically named) symbols.
  - Define a `EDM4HEP2LCIOCONV_NAMESPACE` preprocessor "symbol" that allows downstream users to make for a slightly smoother transition.

* 2023-07-31 jmcarcell ([PR#26](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/26))
  - `CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME` to `PROJECT_NAME` since `CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME` is the name of the top-level project and `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of the current project.

* 2023-07-31 Thomas Madlener ([PR#25](https://github.com/key4hep/k4EDM4hep2LcioConv/pull/25))
  - Make an output message less confusing
