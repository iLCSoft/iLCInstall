================================
 Mokka : mokka-07-07
================================


    What is new in this Mokka release
    =================================

      I. Improvements of the FTD driver

     II. The step position saving for the SDHcal

    III. Improvements of the AHCAL Barrel

     IV. Improvements of the TPC implementation

      V. Definition of three new detector models

     VI. Further improvements of Mokka implementation

    =================================

    Please note that:

       This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.4 (and 9.4.patch01) and
       CLHEP 2.1.0.1

       It was tested against GEAR v01-00 and LCIO v02-00, gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2, 
       SL4 and SL5.

    =================================

     I. Improvements of the FTD driver

      Thanks to Jordi Duarte new improvements are available in the FTD driver:

      * Included the z-staggered design of the petals.

         - The driver is compatible with both designs (staggered and turbine-blade).
           The database is containing a new field in the "disks" table: 
           petal_support_zoffset which define the stagger distance in z for the
           petals.
             Database ftd08 : z_offset=0.0, 
            petal_inclination_angle_support = 4.0 ---> turbine-blade design
             Database ftd09 : z_offset=1.5, 
            petal_inclination_angle_support  = 0.0----> staggered design,

           The FTD version for the new models (in the "ingredients" table) is the 
           SFtd10, but for optimization studies the SFtd09 subdetector (SFtd06.cc 
           and ftd08, turbine-design) can be used.

      * Included the GEAR persistency using the new FTDParameter and FTDLayerLayout 
        classes 

      * Fixed some geometric bugs (z-position of the sensor was not compatible 
        with the mechanical design)

      * Changed the FTD codification in the CGA/EncoderSi class and propagated the 
        change in the Tesla/TRKSD_FTD00 sensitive class.


    II. The step position saving for the SDHcal

        In ' Detailed Shower Mode ' (while using  the command   
        /Mokka/init/lcioDetailedShowerMode true ), the step position in the SDHcal 
        sensitive volume is written to the LCIO file, together with the secondary 
        PDG.


    III. Improvements of the AHCAL Barrel

        Thanks to Shaojun Lu, several improvements are available for the HCAL 
        Barrel:

        1. Put absorber and cassette into one: 20mm
        2. Remove cassette box from deriver for Barrel layer: 0.5mm
        3. Added Hcal_fiber_gap back into Barel layer: 1.7mm
        4. Remove layer_support_length from driver for Barrel layer: 0mm
        5. Update driver for lateral_structure_thickness, it only in the middle 
           between the two modules: 15mm
        6. Remove lateral_structure_thickness between Barrel and electronics 
           service. There could not be steel wall between readout electronics 
           board and HBU electronics baord.
        7. BarrelChamberSupportTrap has been removed from both header and source 
           code.
        8. Barrel module has been place with rotation, to keep the "lateral 
           structure" in the middle for both module.
        9. Update chamber_z_offset from "0" to "-Hcal_lateral_plate_thickness/2.0".
       10. All the relative x/y/z length and shift has been updated with the updated
           modification and parameters.
       11. The I-coordinate calculation has been updated inside "SHcalBarrel.cc". 
           Due to the rotation of Module inside ScHcalSc03, rotation for 
           I-coordinate has been updated too inside "SHcalBarrel.cc".


     IV. Improvements of the TPC implementation

      Thanks to Steve Aplin several improvements are available for the TPC driver:

      - the material of the TPC cathode grip ring was changed to carbon, and 
      - its dimension in z was reduced from 30 mm to 15 mm.


     V. Definition of three new detector models

        Three new ILD models were created, which contain the FTD, TPC, AHcal above 
        mentionned improvements  and - one of the models - the SDHcal. 

        The three models are: 

        ILD_01_pre02      - AHCal  and  Si-Ecal
        ILD_01_SDH_pre00  - SDHCal and  Si-Ecal
        ILD_01_SciW_pre00 - AHCal  and  Scintillator-Ecal


    VI. Further improvements of Mokka implementation

        Thanks to Frank Gaede, we have changes in the Coil drivers' Gear 
        parameters and the rename of CellID to CellID1 for SimTrackerHit.



================================
 MokkaDBConfig : v03-02
================================

    includes latest dump of the Mokka database
        mokka-07-07-dbdump.sql.tgz (taken on 2011.09.23-15:00)

        * Show frames per secounds (select it from the menu)
        * Enhanced fisheye view by adding zoom levels when view mode toggles,
          or when switches to side, front or reset view

        * Add a new optional draw style for the detector, called "New view" includes:
            * Detector cuts: longitudinal (press and hold 'z' or 'Z')
              and transversal cuts (select it from the menu)
            * Its possible to change the value of the transparence (menu)
            * in 3d-view also added a line model for better identification
            * Inner edges can be different from outeredges, and the inner cylinder can be
              rotated with an other angle as the outer cylinder shape
            * Its possible to set a flag in GEO_Tube objects, so that they only
              get drawn in new view, see marlinCED.c for an example


   * Fixes/Intern stuff (H. Hoelbe, DESY):
        * Fixed mouse-wheel functionality for Ubuntu
        * Changed CED from a c to a c++ project
        * Change order of drawing items

    - added OpenGL library paths to the rpath list for preventing LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        (set by geant4 env init script) to overwrite the opengl system libraries used
        in the linking of glced with the ones from Mesa (installed in afs), which might
        cause a dramatic performance penalty



================================
 CEDViewer : v01-03
================================

   -  added new TrackerRawViewer

       - displays raw data from LCTPC large prototype

 MarlinUtil : v01-04
================================

    New features:

        - MarlinCED:
            - added more subdetectors: FTD, LHCal, LCal, Coil, Yoke, SIT

            - changed detector colors to match the default colors used in Mokka

            - detector components have now layers and layer description

            - Cylinder: inner edges can be different from outeredges, and the inner
                cylinder can be rotated with an other angle as the outer cylinder shape

            - made compatible with CLIC (no LHCal and 11 FTD layers):
               LHCal is now optional and the FTD is drawn dynamically from gear....


         To use the new CED features use CED_GeoTube instead of CED_GeoCylinder.


        - header files now installed into subdirectory (marlinutil) to avoid name clashes
            still backwards compatible

        - moved classes FPCCDData and FPCCDPixelHit from MarlinReco
            to MarlinUtil to avoid dependency of Overlay on MarlinReco


    Fixes:

        - MarlinCED:
            - old ced_hit_id is now deprecated (the old ced_hit_id used one int to store type and layer number).
                The new one have one argument more, (layer and type are now 2 fields)

        - overlay.py: added dependency to MarlinReco

    
    general changes and bug fixes:

        - added ILCSoft.cmake.env.sh to initialize environment for developers
            - any package can be configured by simply typing: cmake ..
            - the following order is used to find packages:

                1. CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable defined in ILCSoft.cmake.env.sh
                    or by setting/exporting into current shell
                
                2. CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH cmake variable defined in ILCSoft.cmake
                    or using cmake's -D command line argument
                
                3. manually defined <PKG>_DIR variables using cmake's -D
                    command line argument

                1. has the lowest precedence and 3. the highest, i.e.
                    <PKG>_DIR variables override any previous
                    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variables.

                NOTE: This order of precedence only applies if variables are
                not already stored in CMakeCache.txt !! In order to clear the
                cache erase CMakeCache.txt or the build directory.


        - removed backwards compatibility for older CMakeModules

        - baseilc.py: added logfile info in case of error (by P. Klenze)
        - baseilc.py: added -dev and -exp suffixes to lookup versions in branches instead of tags
        - marlin.py: need to unset MARLIN_DLL for running tests (MARLIN_DLL could otherwise include a plugin which has not yet been built)
