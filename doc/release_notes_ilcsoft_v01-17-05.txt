=================================================

 Changes in v01-17-05  w.r.t. iLCSoft v01-17-04
 
=================================================

===========================

   - modified to optionally change the relative position of
    the measurement surface within the sensitive layer
     => needed for example in the FPCCD

  - optionally users can add
     <parameter name="relative_position_of_measurement_surface" type="double"value="0.15"/>
   to the VXD parameter section in the GEAR file


===========================
 dd4HEP v00-06
===========================

2014/02/04  Frank Gaede
-----------------------
  - fixed environment scripts thisdd4hep.sh and this${PackageName}.sh
    to also export library pathes for external libraries (CLHEP, LCIO, gear)

  - added some simple tests to ILDExDet, ILDExSimu and noviceN04
    - provide cmake script run_test_package.sh ( configured as run_test_${PackageName} ) 
      to call test binaries after initializing the environment
      (needed for automated/nightly tests)

  - updated Readme.txt wrt build procedure and running the tests


2014/01/17    Markus Frank
--------------------------
  - Prepare implementation of Alignment using Release and Grap features of TGeoVolume
    and TGeoNode. In principle this was done in a backwards compatible way, but 
    I cannot really check 100% the #ifdef's.
  - Fix handling of XML collections using XercesC.
    (Bug reported by P.Kostka).
  - Fix several compiler warnings issued by Coverity.

2013/12/17    Markus Frank
--------------------------
  - Whole load of fixes to keep coverity quiet....
  - Fix bug in DDG4 field interface component
  - Allow the usage of units, positions and lorentzvectors and in DDG4 properties.
    Example using a position property (ROOT::Math::XYZVector):
    Idle> /ddg4/Gun/position (1*mm,1*cm,0.01*m) 
    Geant4UIMessenger: +++ Gun> Setting property value position = (1*mm,1*cm,0.01*m)  
                       native:( 1 , 10 , 10 ).

  - Support for std::vector<T>/std::list<T>/std::set<T> properties.

  - Support for include directives of the format
        <include ref="file-name"/>
    for the top level <lccdd> tags
       Parent tag    Included root tag  Data content
    -- <lccdd>       <define>           See below.
                     <detectors>
                     <detector>
                     <display>
                     <lccdd>            Nested includes (with DTD validation for Xerces-C)
    -- <define>      <define>           Set of constants
    -- <detectors>   <detector>         Single XML subdetector description
    -- <detectors>   <detectors>        Multiple XML subdetector descriptions
    -- <display>     <display>          Set ov visualization attributes

    DTD validation is only performed using Xerces-C for root tags <lccdd>.

    Note: 
    <lccdd> include directives are executed BEFORE any other directive!
    Other include directives are executed BEFORE the corresponding named directive!

2013/11/14    Markus Frank
--------------------------
  - Reformat files in DDCode and DDG4 to remove the <TAB>s from the source files.
    Hopefully the content is now more readable.
  - DDCore: Remove empty and named constructors for shapes. Empty constructors
    were simply a dangerous hook to memory leaks, named constructors are 
    deprecated since along time.
  - DDG4: add support for messengers to access and modify properties from
    the Geant4 prompt. For the test hit classes and the simple sensitive 
    detector a ROOT I/O plugin was provided.
  - DDG4: Split into several libraries:
     -- libDD4hepG4.so pure    link library without any plugins
     -- libDD4hepG4Legacy.so   'Old' plugins. The old stuff at some point
                               will have to disappear.
     -- libDD4hepG4Plugins.so  New framework plugins
     -- libDD4hepG4LCIO.so     LCIO output plugin for new framework

2013/11/03    Markus Frank
--------------------------
  - doc: Add CHEP2013 paper about DD4hep as a start of the documentation 
    section. More to come hopefully.
  - DDCore: several small improvements:
    - Segmentations are no longer Ref_t's.
    - Base internal implementing object directly on the segmentations 
      classes from Christian.
    - Rearrangement of some code from Handle.h to Primitives.h
    - Allow to attach extensions to LCDD
  - DDG4: Fix Frank's simulation problem, which he caused himself
    introducing his famous factories....
  - DDG4: First attempt to fix simulation problem with mignetic field.
    Ready for testing.
  - DDG4: First commit of a independent simulation aimed for LHCb and LHeC
    + other newcomers. Documentation needs to be written.
    Features:
    - Modular setup of all Geant4 action routines as plugins, including the
      Run-, event-, tracking-, stacking-, stepping- and generator-actions 
      as well as the physics lists with particle and physics constructors.
    - Setup is possible in XML or with C++ either as an AClick in root or
      standalone. Python based starter to come.
    - Missing is a modular description of the G4 UI and VIS manager(s).
    - Documentation is to come. Before documentation is not present
      the usage is discouraged.
    Note:
    - This version of DDG4 uses boost::spirit. It will compile without
      the BOOST include files and the old functionality is preserved, 
      but it will not work.
      To use BOOST add to the cmake statement the following tags:
      cmake <regular tags> \
      -DDD4HEP_USE_BOOST=ON \
      -DBOOST_INCLUDE_DIR=${BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR}  ....
      Where BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR should point to the boost header directory.
      BOOST libraries are not used.

==================================
 pathfinder v00-06 (by I. Heinze)
==================================
  - cleaned up code & directories , fix typos
  - added doxygen comments everywhere
  - added class HoughSpaceAnalyser to save plots of Hough spaces
  - added class HoughMapMaximumCandidateFinder, which does the search of the Hough maps for the maxima, before this was done in every kind of Hough map
  - added a class called HoughMap2DuntIntersectionMethod, which is not used yet, but it is an idea for further development
  - fixed bug in TrackGenerator




====================
  MarlinTPC v00-16
====================
(A. Munnich, P. Hayman, C. Kleinwort, F. Mueller, Li Bo, Ch. Krieger, D. Sankar, Ch. Rosemann) -- lots of bug fixes

(P. Hayman )
- Addition of MM reconstruction (see log for details)

(A. Munnich)
- Added a new flag for the pulses with a plateau. They were previously flagges as anomolous shape. Added a electron particle gun for our LP1 test beam geometry in preparation for detailed simulation.
- First version of analysis processor for dEdx. Needs some more testing and tweaking probably. + root scripts
-  several updates to detailed simulation (check logs for details)
- fixes in ModuleDistortionCalculator.
- Major rewrite of the HitDistributor (detailes see below). It should now work more correctly. Full testing not finished. Charge fluctuation on pads still seem somewhat large, but could also be due to electronics processor.

Modified:  HitDistributor called from ChargeDistributionProcessor
           - Fixed errors, e.g. list of hit pads was wrong
	   - Rewrite of code for clearer structure, avoiding the same code repeating in different functions
	   - Introduced correct handling and usage of TPCModule
	   - Introduced local and global coordinate systems. Now also translated and rotated modules work
Added:  
- test for the behaviour of the HitDistributor
- test for the new TPCGas class

(Ch. Rosemann)
Changed BField access method from strange to 
 1) initialization of data by ConditionsProcessor
 2) loading of the field with the LoadFieldFromConditionsDataProcessor [takes as option the coil coordinate system]
 3) getting it with 
		gear::Vector3D bfield = marlin::Global::GEAR->getBField().at( gear::Vector3D arbitrary_position);
NOTE: needs a b field map; still to be loaded into the database

C. Kleinwort
- StepWiseHelixGeneralBrokenLineInterfaceProcessor (following changes in Bz) implemented.
Needs track reference point inside magnet. RowTripletBasedTrackFinderProcessor uses as default now 1. hit as reference point. 
- A local helix with bending plane perpendicular to an arbitray magnetic field is now used by StepWiseHelixGeneralBrokenLineInterfaceProcessor to propagate in an changing (only locally constant) field

(Li Bo)
- Added modulesNotUsed in TrackMakingKalmanFilterProcessor 

(Ch. Krieger)
 Changed TimePixMaskCreatorProcessor so it does not need any more an occupancy histogram (which was required but not used before), dead and noisy pixels are now defined via processor params instead of setting them in the processors source code






=================================================

 Changes in v01-17-04  w.r.t. iLCSoft v01-17-03
 
=================================================

Introduces a new package:
=====================
SlicPandora v01-00-00
=====================
	by J. McCormick


==============
LCIO v02-04-03
==============

        - Added a statement about the minimum python version to use

        - Adapted the example to the changed interface in EventLoop.


=================
MOKKA mokka-08-03
=================

! Corrected the density value of Nitrogen gas, and Changed the input  density
of Cherenkov gas by the pressure. (Shaojun Lu)

+ Add new driver TBcatcher09 for the CALICE TailCatcher (Angela Lucaci-Timoce)

- the previous driver (TBcatcher08) had a bug in the
  TBcatcher08::BuildCatcherLayers()
 
  for (G4int i = 0; i < n_layers; i++)
     {
       // here is the line with the bug
       // bool withCassette = (_layerPattern.data()[i-1] == '1');
       // the line below is the correct one
       bool withCassette = (_layerPattern.data()[i] == '1');

the boolean withCassette was always false for i=0 (i.e. for the first layer).
As a result, the first fine layer was never build.

- The sensitive detector was changed to TBSD_VCell04.
  With respect to the AHCAL case, for the TailCatcher a 1 is added 
  in the layer number (otherwise we get layers from 0 to 15, instead of layers from 1 to 16)

 (I checked that previous TailCatcher drivers use TBSD_VCell03 as sensitive detector,
  therefore they will not affected by this change.)


! fixed naming of pointer variables: (Frank Gaede)
   removed duplicate class name qualifiers (TBSD_VCell03::TBSD_VCell03)


====================
DD4HEP DD4hep v00-05
====================

        Markus Frank:
  - Throw exception if the expression evaluator sees a problem.
    The message printed before was often not seen.
  - Improve printout on exceptions and plugin abortion
  - Remove the typedef RotationZYX -> Rotation and
    import the type RotationZYX from ROOT::Math.

  - Add more explicit error messages in case a plugin is not found.
  - Add file TGeoUnits.h, which allows to use the "usual SystemOfUnits"
    from CLHEP using TGeo with the namespace tgeo::xxx
    Example: tgeo::mm -> 0.1 (Geant3: cm, sec,  GeV, degree)
                 ::mm -> 1.0 (Geant4: mm, nsec, MeV, radian)
    I hope I got all translations right.
    Geant4                                   Geant3
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    millimeter         mm=1,cm=10            centimeter  mm=0.1,cm=1
    nanosecond         s=1e9                 second      ns=1e-9,s=1
    Mega electron Volt GeV=1e3               GeV         GeV=1
    radian             rad=1                 degree      rad=180/pi

    Unclear to me was if in Geant3 steradian is also 2*2*pi or 2*2*180 degree.

        F. Gaede:
       - changes to build system:
         (see ReadMe.txt for details)

         - moved examples to ./example directory   
           - they are not built as part of DD4hep anymore

         - install thisdd4hep.sh in ./bin
           (modified to have the correct pathes) 

         - added -DINSTALL_DOC=on/off option
           to build doxygen documentation (in ./doc/html/index.html)

         - create DD4hepConfig.cmake for easy building against DD4hep
           ( see examples CMakeLists.txt)

       - fixed doxygen API documentation (C.Rosemann)
          (greatly improved with many graphs)


=================
MarlinReco v01-08
=================


 - John Marshall:
	Update fillECALGaps function, so that it remains identical to that implemented in NewLDCCaloDigi processor (i.e. copy the NewLDCCaloDigi updates from 9th Jan 2013).
   Apply HCAL "other" calibration constant to both ring and plug calorimeter hit types.

================
MarlinTPC v00-15
================
        General remarks: Following the analysis workshop at KEK several new analysis processors were
        developed and added. Each comes with a corresponding root script to make the corresponding graph/plot.
        A style file has been added to be used to make plots, so they look consistent.

      in $PATH directories, before looking in /usr/bin; this makes sure
      that the ROOT version installed with ILCsoft or local
      installations (if existing/set up correctly) are preferred over
      system-wide packages and avoids conflicts between the
      installtions.

 MarlinPandora: v00-11
==============================

************************************************************************
TAG V00-11 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Protect against missing/unavailable TrackStates.
Add modifications to allow use of hybrid ScW/SiW and full ScW ECAL models.

************************************************************************
TAG V00-10 FOLLOWING REPOSITORY RESTRUCTURING
************************************************************************
CMake and Makefile changes following updated treatment of the libraries that constitute the PandoraPFANew package.

GENERAL INFO:
Pandora consists of the PandoraSDK (Software Development Kit), which comprises a single library and header files with flexible APIs.
There is also an optional PandoraMonitoring library, which contains event display and tree/histogram-writing functionality.
The PandoraMonitoring library depends on the PandoraSDK and ROOT.
Pandora algorithms will necessarily depend upon the PandoraSDK (and also PandoraMonitoring, if desired).
The algorithms can be built as part of a Pandora client application, such as MarlinPandora, or the standalone TestPandora binary.
Algorithms declared to be suitably generic may be designed for use by multiple client applications.
Such re-usable algorithms are best bundled together into a Pandora "content" library.
Algorithms are always registered via the client application, using the PandoraAPIs, but the client app can link against as many content libraries as required.


Recover daughter or sibling tracks if they are flagged as unable to form a pfo.
Copy track states from input lcio tracks.
Fix subdetector hit number encoding.
Write out track subset collections to investigate different track usage in pfa.
Updated TrackCreator class to work with either ILD00 or ILD01 geometry.

 Changes in v01-17-02  w.r.t. iLCSoft v01-17-01
 
=================================================


===================
 LCIO v02-04-01
===================

    - LCReader/SIOReader sets the RunHeader parameter "LCIOFileName" to the current file name (usefull if a list of files is processed)
    
    - bug fix in SIOReader:  used to hold pointer to StringVec argument of SIOReader::open(StringVec& files) - now the filenames are copied to local class member variable 
   
    - added missing const keywords for getValue() and highestBit() in UTIL::BitField64  (Ch.Grefe)


===================
 MarlinUtil v01-07
==================
 - split up library into libMarlinUtil and libMarlinUtil_ann

=============
 LCCD v01-03:
=============
      - updated all database test binaries 
         source/test/conddbtests/multiblefolders.cc
         source/test/conddbtests/calfiletodb.cc
         source/test/conddbtests/calfilefromdb.cc
         source/test/conddbtests/createdbfile.cc
       to take the db folder as argument on the command line as part of the DBcol name
       example:
       ./bin/calfiletodb condDB_channelmapping_HEAD_20130604_155014.slcio channelmapping /lctpc/test/channelmapping 0 999999

     - bug fix: wrong declaration logic (made obvious by coverity bugfix):
       move declaration and initialization outside loop in LCGenericObjectStreamer

======================
CondDBMySQL_ILC-0-9-6
======================
	- updated boot-sql.h to newer MySQL syntax


=================================================

 Changes in v01-17-01  w.r.t. iLCSoft v01-17
 
=================================================

New packages added to iLCSoft:


GBL: General Broken Lines (K.Kleinworth, Ch.Rosemann)

DD4hep: Geometry description (M.Frank, P.Mato)

SLIC, XercesC, HepPDT, GDML, LCDD - Slic geant4 simulation (J.McCormick)



===============
 LCIO: v02-04
===============
  
  - Ch.Grefe, CERN
    added a new python binding: pyLCIO based on the optional ROOT dictionary
    see: $LCIO/examples/python/README for examples on how to use it

 
  - added new method to limit the collections that are going to be read 
    from a file:
      LCReader::setReadCollectionNames(const std::vector<std::string>& cn)
    - C++ only so far
    - anajob and dumpevent now read variable LCIO_READ_COL_NAMES with
      space separated list of colection names to read only these

  - pointers to LCObjects that are not in the event are now set to NULL
    
  - an Exception is thrown if a null pointer is found in a subset collection
    (e.g. if LCIO_READ_COL_NAMES is set inconsistently such that 
     the collection(s) holding the elements is not read )

    - this behavior can be deactivated with setting the environment variable
      LCIO_IGNORE_NULL_IN_SUBSET_COLLECTIONS=1
      if really needed, e.g. to read inconsistent or corrupt files

  - added build option for C++ only builds
    using pre-genetarated header files:
     cmake -DLCIO_GENERATE_HEADERS=OFF ..

    - note: header files will have to be updated manually by developers
      after changing the class layout

  - some minor fixes:
    - fix missing include issue in UTIL/LCIterator.h for latest ubuntu
    - update freehep-sio dep to 2.3
    - enforce cmake version >= 2.8


================
 Marlin: v01-05
===============

      - new optional global parameter: "LCIOReadCollectionNames"
        allows to restrict the collection that are read from the 
        LCIO file(s) to the ones given 
        ( needs LCIO v02-04 )

      - new command line option (H.Perrey, DESY):
         -u : consistency check and updated version of xml file

      - fix problem with ROOT seg fault at program end:
        do not call dlclose on shared libraries anymmore
        (A.Sailer)



=================
  CED: v01-09
=================

    - turned off C++ name mangling in client library libCED.so/dylib
      to facilitate calling ced from python

===================
 CEDViewer: v01-07
===================

   - changed calling attributes of ced_hit_ID to newer version
     -> needed for CED v01-09 which has no function overloading 
        in library anymore (c-style)
 
  - changed the default conventions for the track state to be drawn. Now the
    following processor options are valid
    -1: do not draw helix
     0: default track state (the 0-th element in the track state vector)
      (the rest options as before)
     1: AtIP
     2: AtFirstHit
     3: AtLastHit
     4: AtCalorimeter
    If no track state were found, exit with an error

 - avoid wrong values for the helix parameters for the case of small curvature
   or zero magnetic field by assigning large value of Pt to the track

 - update for the multi-module support via generic GEAR interface

===================
 Clupatra: v00-10
===================

    - bug fix: remove sqrt from computation of r_phi_res^2 for finding best
      hit
    - included multi-module TPC support via GEAR interface
    - ignore hits that are outside of the TPC range (possible in data)
    - added new processor FixCellIDs_Error_TestBeam (based on the original
      FixCellIDs)
       that sets the correct hit CellIDs and hit uncertainties for test beam
data
    - added examples for test beam data. Look at examples/README for more
      details

===================
 LCTuple: v01-03
===================
   -  added support for TrackerHits


================
 KalDet: v01-12
================

         - added detector geometry for lctpc which is now based on ild
           classes. Notes:
         - it is compatible with Clupatra/MarlinTrk
         - the correspondence between row number and module is represented in
           a different way
           compared to the original class GearTPCKalDetector. In the current
implementation,
           row numbers are global, i.e. rows of different modules but with the
same center are
           now the same rows! This is needed to unify the measurement layers
that are
           combinations of several modules.

====================
 MarlinTPC: v00-13
====================

   - A. Muennich: added preparation processors for Clupatra test beam data
     usage
                  added a processor ADC2PrimaryElectronFactorCalculator (needs
conditions object transformation)
                  added a helper tool to calculate intersection between circle
and track in global coordinates
                  Reimplementation of the splitting in the PulseFinder:
                  bug fix to HitCopier
   - F. Mueller:  added two more methods to calculate pulse time
                  correction of hit error calculation
   - S. Caiazza:  added documentation
   - F. Gaede:    added extension to CED
   - I. Heinze: Extended CutApplicationProcessor so that tracks with more than
     one hit per row can be cut out.
   - O . Volynets introduced new track description with MarlinTrk
   - M. Killenberg: Wrote documentation for the IntersectionCalculator
   - Ch. Rosemann: added first version of straight line fitting in row based
     TPC with general broken lines
                   HitCopier added
   + Bug fixes by I. Heinze, A. Muennich, M. Killenberg, T. Krautscheid, O.
Volynets, F. Mueller, F. Gaede, Ch. Rosemann


===================
 MarlinTrk: v01-11
===================

         - Improved readability of the MarlinTrkUtils functions
         - Added LCTPC-specific modifications:
           - geometry building is now based on the detector name from GEAR
           - Magnetic field may be zero -> avoid the value of infinity for
             kappa
           - Interaction Point (IP) meas. layer may not exist for LCTPC
           - Do not throw exception if the layer is not found, return
             "no_intersection" code
             instead. This avoids the problem if some of the state is not or
cannot be available,
             e.g. the IP and CaloFace states are not (yet?) defined for the
LCTPC geometry

================================
 MarlinTrkProcessors: v01-09-01
================================

      - updated calling attrinbutes of ced_hit_ID to new CED v01-09

==============================
 MarlinUtil: v01-06-01
==============================

    - adopted for multi-module support in MarlinCED for the TPC detector

===========================
 GEAR v01-03:
===========================
     - F.Gaede: added test/testInteractionLengths
      new example program to print interaction lengths as a function
      of theta for different cylinders between the calorimeters
    - updated testMaterialBudgetNew.cc: incl. 1st layer of Ecal

     - two pi wrap around for coordinates in TPCModuleImpl (Bo Li)



===========================
 CED v01-08:
===========================
      New features (A. Miyamoto):

    - Add "Auto shot" flag in Tools menu of glced.
      When set, glced write a screen image to a file when new event is received from
      CED client. The file is written in a directory where glced is executed with
      a name, glced-N.tga, where N is a sequence number.  If an environment variable,
      CED_IMAGEFILE is set, output file name is ${CED_IMAGEFILE}-N.tga.  Note that
      a file could be written at any place by including a directory in ${CED_IMAGEFILE}.

      A menu, Tools->Auto scale, can be used to select the scale of output image.

    - A CMake variable, CED_NOT_INCLUDE_OPENGL_LINKER_PATH.  If set,
      OpenGL linker path is not included in rpath of glced. Inclusion of
      the OpenGL path caused a problem at run time when gcc used for OpenGL
      is older than those used to build glced.

    - Add 2 more CED_HIT_TYPE, CED_HIT_BOX and CED_HIT_VXD. Then will be used
      to display pixel hits of FPCCD.

      New feature (O. Volynets):

    - Added shortcut ctrl+s for fast saving of screenshots in original size (i.e. without scaling)


===========================
 MarlinReco v01-07:
===========================
   
  - Manqi Ruan: added new clas G2D:
     Include G2CD, a general digitizer for gaseous hadron calorimeter. It takes 1mm simulated Hcal hits as input,
     and output digitized hits with tunable sell size. Efficiency and Multiplicity effects are also taken into 
     account, which can be adjusted in the steering file
  
  - J.List: fixed BCalTagEfficiency:
      adapted efficiency parametrisation for ECM=1TeV

  - Katsushige Coterra: updated NewLDCCaloDigi.cc
    for the Scintillator Strip Ecal reconstruction
