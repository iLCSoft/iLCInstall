#
#################################

Developers release that provides many smaller fixes and a 
number of new features as well as a number of new packages.


=================================================

 Changes in v01-17-01  w.r.t. iLCSoft v01-17
 
=================================================

New packages added to iLCSoft:


GBL: General Broken Lines (K.Kleinworth, Ch.Rosemann)

DD4hep: Geometry description (M.Frank, P.Mato)

SLIC, XercesC, HepPDT, GDML, LCDD - Slic geant4 simulation (J.McCormick)



===============
 LCIO: v02-04
===============
  
  - Ch.Grefe, CERN
    added a new python binding: pyLCIO based on the optional ROOT dictionary
    see: $LCIO/examples/python/README for examples on how to use it

 
  - added new method to limit the collections that are going to be read 
    from a file:
      LCReader::setReadCollectionNames(const std::vector<std::string>& cn)
    - C++ only so far
    - anajob and dumpevent now read variable LCIO_READ_COL_NAMES with
      space separated list of colection names to read only these

  - pointers to LCObjects that are not in the event are now set to NULL
    
  - an Exception is thrown if a null pointer is found in a subset collection
    (e.g. if LCIO_READ_COL_NAMES is set inconsistently such that 
     the collection(s) holding the elements is not read )

    - this behavior can be deactivated with setting the environment variable
      LCIO_IGNORE_NULL_IN_SUBSET_COLLECTIONS=1
      if really needed, e.g. to read inconsistent or corrupt files

  - added build option for C++ only builds
    using pre-genetarated header files:
     cmake -DLCIO_GENERATE_HEADERS=OFF ..

    - note: header files will have to be updated manually by developers
      after changing the class layout

  - some minor fixes:
    - fix missing include issue in UTIL/LCIterator.h for latest ubuntu
    - update freehep-sio dep to 2.3
    - enforce cmake version >= 2.8


================
 Marlin: v01-05
===============

      - new optional global parameter: "LCIOReadCollectionNames"
        allows to restrict the collection that are read from the 
        LCIO file(s) to the ones given 
        ( needs LCIO v02-04 )

      - new command line option (H.Perrey, DESY):
         -u : consistency check and updated version of xml file

      - fix problem with ROOT seg fault at program end:
        do not call dlclose on shared libraries anymmore
        (A.Sailer)



=================
  CED: v01-09
=================

    - turned off C++ name mangling in client library libCED.so/dylib
      to facilitate calling ced from python

===================
 CEDViewer: v01-07
===================

   - changed calling attributes of ced_hit_ID to newer version
     -> needed for CED v01-09 which has no function overloading 
        in library anymore (c-style)
 
  - changed the default conventions for the track state to be drawn. Now the
    following processor options are valid
    -1: do not draw helix
     0: default track state (the 0-th element in the track state vector)
      (the rest options as before)
     1: AtIP
     2: AtFirstHit
     3: AtLastHit
     4: AtCalorimeter
    If no track state were found, exit with an error

 - avoid wrong values for the helix parameters for the case of small curvature
   or zero magnetic field by assigning large value of Pt to the track

 - update for the multi-module support via generic GEAR interface

===================
 Clupatra: v00-10
===================

    - bug fix: remove sqrt from computation of r_phi_res^2 for finding best
      hit
    - included multi-module TPC support via GEAR interface
    - ignore hits that are outside of the TPC range (possible in data)
    - added new processor FixCellIDs_Error_TestBeam (based on the original
      FixCellIDs)
       that sets the correct hit CellIDs and hit uncertainties for test beam
data
    - added examples for test beam data. Look at examples/README for more
      details

===================
 LCTuple: v01-03
===================
   -  added support for TrackerHits


================
 KalDet: v01-12
================

         - added detector geometry for lctpc which is now based on ild
           classes. Notes:
         - it is compatible with Clupatra/MarlinTrk
         - the correspondence between row number and module is represented in
           a different way
           compared to the original class GearTPCKalDetector. In the current
implementation,
           row numbers are global, i.e. rows of different modules but with the
same center are
           now the same rows! This is needed to unify the measurement layers
that are
           combinations of several modules.

====================
 MarlinTPC: v00-13
====================

   - A. Muennich: added preparation processors for Clupatra test beam data
     usage
                  added a processor ADC2PrimaryElectronFactorCalculator (needs
conditions object transformation)
                  added a helper tool to calculate intersection between circle
and track in global coordinates
                  Reimplementation of the splitting in the PulseFinder:
                  bug fix to HitCopier
   - F. Mueller:  added two more methods to calculate pulse time
                  correction of hit error calculation
   - S. Caiazza:  added documentation
   - F. Gaede:    added extension to CED
   - I. Heinze: Extended CutApplicationProcessor so that tracks with more than
     one hit per row can be cut out.
   - O . Volynets introduced new track description with MarlinTrk
   - M. Killenberg: Wrote documentation for the IntersectionCalculator
   - Ch. Rosemann: added first version of straight line fitting in row based
     TPC with general broken lines
                   HitCopier added
   + Bug fixes by I. Heinze, A. Muennich, M. Killenberg, T. Krautscheid, O.
Volynets, F. Mueller, F. Gaede, Ch. Rosemann


===================
 MarlinTrk: v01-11
===================

         - Improved readability of the MarlinTrkUtils functions
         - Added LCTPC-specific modifications:
           - geometry building is now based on the detector name from GEAR
           - Magnetic field may be zero -> avoid the value of infinity for
             kappa
           - Interaction Point (IP) meas. layer may not exist for LCTPC
           - Do not throw exception if the layer is not found, return
             "no_intersection" code
             instead. This avoids the problem if some of the state is not or
cannot be available,
             e.g. the IP and CaloFace states are not (yet?) defined for the
LCTPC geometry

================================
 MarlinTrkProcessors: v01-09-01
================================

      - updated calling attrinbutes of ced_hit_ID to new CED v01-09

==============================
 MarlinUtil: v01-06-01
==============================

    - adopted for multi-module support in MarlinCED for the TPC detector

===========================



=========================================
 Changed packages with interface changes
=========================================


===========================
 GEAR v01-03:
===========================
     - F.Gaede: added test/testInteractionLengths
      new example program to print interaction lengths as a function
      of theta for different cylinders between the calorimeters
    - updated testMaterialBudgetNew.cc: incl. 1st layer of Ecal

    - added example macros for DBD material plots:
       ./example/drawintlen_DBD.C
       ./example/drawmat_DBD.C
       ./example/treeFromAscii.C

  - C.Rosemann: fixed many issues found by coverity
    mostly unitialized member variables
    GearMgrImpl.cc:make assignment operator and copy c'tor private
    -> see Changelog for details

  - M.Killenberg: wrote XML documentation for the VersatileDiskRowLayout
     doc/VersatileDiskRowLayoutXML.*
    - improved the documentation of localToGlobal and globalToLocal in TPCModule
    - speedup of TPCParametersImpl::getModule(), removed duplicate search in map

     - two pi wrap around for coordinates in TPCModuleImpl (Bo Li)



===========================
 CED v01-08:
===========================
      New features (A. Miyamoto):

    - Add "Auto shot" flag in Tools menu of glced.
      When set, glced write a screen image to a file when new event is received from
      CED client. The file is written in a directory where glced is executed with
      a name, glced-N.tga, where N is a sequence number.  If an environment variable,
      CED_IMAGEFILE is set, output file name is ${CED_IMAGEFILE}-N.tga.  Note that
      a file could be written at any place by including a directory in ${CED_IMAGEFILE}.

      A menu, Tools->Auto scale, can be used to select the scale of output image.

    - A CMake variable, CED_NOT_INCLUDE_OPENGL_LINKER_PATH.  If set,
      OpenGL linker path is not included in rpath of glced. Inclusion of
      the OpenGL path caused a problem at run time when gcc used for OpenGL
      is older than those used to build glced.

    - Add 2 more CED_HIT_TYPE, CED_HIT_BOX and CED_HIT_VXD. Then will be used
      to display pixel hits of FPCCD.

     and output digitized hits with tunable sell size. Efficiency and Multiplicity effects are also taken into 
     account, which can be adjusted in the steering file
  
  - J.List: fixed BCalTagEfficiency:
      adapted efficiency parametrisation for ECM=1TeV

  - Katsushige Coterra: updated NewLDCCaloDigi.cc
    for the Scintillator Strip Ecal reconstruction

        - added small test/example to ./src/cpp/src/TESTS/test_tracks.cc

    - Operators.cc: fixed scientific format for Track/TrackState

    - changed TrackState (convenience) copy constructor argument type to reference instead of pointer

    - fixed potential memory leak by adding Track's assignment operator (c++ rule of three)

    - added LCIO_JAVA_USE_MAVEN option to build lcio.jar library using maven



===========================
MarlinTrk: v01-09
===========================

      - General
        - Made Debug output more consistent

      - IMarlinTrack
        - Moved constant definitions of return codes outside of the header file.
        - Added additional error return, for the case where no site are filtered when calling fit.

      - MarlinKalTestTrack
        - Prefer translation over rotation of the trackstate early in the fit, when using simple helix initialisation

      - MarlinTrkUtils
        - Use EVENT::TrackState in place of IMPL::TrackStateImpl where appropriate.
        - The TrackState for the initialisation can be at any reference point.



===========================
MarlinTrkProcessors: v01-07
===========================

  General:

      - Debug output has been made more consistent throughout.

  FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk

      - Use existing tracks parameters when refitting.
      - Updated for new lcio TrackState copy constructor taking const reference.

  TruthTracker

      - Updated for new lcio TrackState copy constructor taking const reference.
      - Corrected Helix orientation for pre-fit.


  RefitProcessor

      - Corrected Helix orientation for pre-fit.
      - Protect against missing truth relations.



===========================
Clupatra: v00-09
===========================

     - apply a refit with larger maximum chi2 increment to tracks that have only
       a small number of hits used (IMarlinTrkFitter::operator())

     - drop poor seed clusters with no hits added except in the very forward (inner) region

     - clupatra_new: added optional  argument TrkSystem* to addHitsAndFilter();
       if given, the smoothed TrackState is used for backward extrapolation;
       => not currently used, i.e. the last filtered  TrackStae is used
       ( this should give better results than the previous version that
         used the filtered TrackState at the 4th hit )

     - don't set quality bit on tracker hit: ILDTrkHitQualityBit::USED_IN_FIT anymore,
       as this won't work on pre-digitized files (and is not unique wrt other pat rec code)

     - added DebugDigiProcessor :
       takes TrackerHits from a collection of Tracks (e.g. previously written
       as ClupatraPoorTrackCollection ) and writes them into new Collections
       ( according to subdetID )
       -> see ./example/clupa_debug.xml

    -  added debug method printAndSaveTrack() to Clupatra:
       allows to store a collection of Tracks selected through picking in CED

    -  added doxygen documentation of parameters in ClupatraProcessor.h

    -  Updated for new lcio TrackState copy constructor taking const reference.




===========================
CEDViewer: v01-06
===========================

 - removed TrackerRawViewer
     - lives now in MarlinTPC
     - CEDViewer no longer optionally depends on MarlinTPC nor LCCD

MarlinTPC: v00-10
===========================


        + added namespace pathfinder to package pathfinder, changed interface processor accordingly
        + removed deprecated files
        + added ced viewer extension for raw data as its own directory: resolves double dependency problem
                ! breaks current ilcsoft installation with ced viewer -> use head version of CEDViewer
        + changed and cleaned CMakeLists.txt file accordingly



===========================
PathFinder: v00-02
===========================


        + introduced namespace pathfinder -- breaks backwards compatability (!)
        + removed obsolete files
        + minor cosmetic changes

=================================================



===========================
 CED : v01-07
===========================

    Fixes/Changes:

    - Updated the manual to the latest CED version

    - Deleted the old pictures

    - New pictures are stored in doc/manual/img/

    - Added undo to help frame

    - Fixed typo in help frame text

    - Fixed a bug with the screenshot function where the axis are drawn at a wrong possition

    - Improve the identification of hits/detector components when
      pick object while  detector picking is enabled

    - Fixed an issue with the popup menu which causes a visible menu
      when right clicking at the same position.

    - The distance calculation between two objects is
      now also affected by selecting objects via double click

    - Instead of highlighting the picked point now the whole detector
      component is highlighted (only visable when detector picking
      is enabled and picking marker enabled).

    - When selecting a detector component by doubleclick this component
      is now also active to modify only this component via shortkeys.

    - Fixed menu detector transparency checkboxes



===========================
MarlinReco: v01-04
===========================

   - SiliconTracker, SiliconTrack_CLIC, TruthTracker: Corrected use of getPointOnCircle from HelixClass (MarlinUtil)
     documentaion wrong said that a float[3] is required, when in fact a float[6] is needed.

   - RecoMCTruthLinker: Improved Debug output for track mcparticle relations.
                Fix for the case were no tracker collections are present.

   - FPCCDDigitizer:    Bug fixed - process for the point on ladder edge.

   - BCalReco:      Removed more uses of cout and cerr. Replaced with streamlog.
                Corrected float instead of integer value for cluster position



===========================
MarlinTrk: v01-08
===========================

      Improvements in Diagnostics.

      - MarlinKalTestTrack
        - Print trkhit id in add hit

      - TrkAnalysisTree
        - Initialise the index values with -1
        - Added run and event number, added reciprocal weights for relations, corrected array sizes in places.



================================
MarlinTrkProcessors: v01-06-01
================================

  General:

      - RIADA dependency added

  FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk:

      - Increased debug output
      - Use fit from TPC to initialise fit when doing SiTrack TPCTrack comparisons.
        Added debug output which can we removed at a later stage
      - Use Tracks from the TPC which are composed only of the innermost segment, which contains the fit needed
        for matching to the Silicon Tracks. The Silicon Track, TPC Track, and the segments are added to the final track,
    which is then itself added to the Final Track collection.
      - Added type bits for the final Track collection.

    - SiliconTracking_MarlinTrk:

      - Make sure that float[6] is used for getPointOnCircle.
      - Added diagnostic histograms.
      - Check error return of fast fitter.
      - Use iopt 2 instead of 3, as newtonian part of fast fitter is not performing well.
      - Added type bits for the final Track collection. Increased debug for FTD tracking.

    - SpacePointBuilder:

      - Added extra check for valid line intersection when creating space points. This fixes problems from very low pt tracks.



===========================
Clupatra: v00-08
===========================

    - changed order of hits in track and hits in fit
      in subdetector hit numbers

    - changed way how curler tracks are written out:
       - store only complete track segments - as used in the fit
       - for merged curlers only the primary segment (closest to IP)
         is stored in track output collection where
         the other segments are referenced through the track pointers
         (sorted in z)

    - no change in algorithm



===========================
LCFIPlus: v00-05-01
===========================

- Improved steering options thanks to P.Roloff
  1) The magnetic field can be specified (default behavior is to read from GEAR).
    2) The beam constraint in the primary vertex fit can be switched off.
    3) The beam size can be adjusted.
    4) The cuts on the number of hits to calculate jointProbD0 and jointProbZ0,
    and to find the most significant track can now be adjusted.

=================================================

 Changes in v01-14 w.r.t. iLCSoft v01-13-06
 
=================================================


===========================
Mokka: mokka-08-00-02
===========================

    - fixed small issue in HepLCIOInterfaceNew with comparison of double to 0.0
    
    - started to addressed issue with MCParticles from calorimeter showers stored in LCIO file:
      commented out SetToBeSaved()  in Control::GetPIDForCalHit()
      - much less shower particles will be added
      - we still get neutrons that cause hits in other parts of the calorimneter use
        /Mokka/init/lcioWriteParentsForBackscatter false
      to activate new treatment ( experimental - needs checking)


    - TRKSiSD00 -- Corrected the storing of the MCParticle responsible for TrackerHits to reflect the way it is done for the other tracking detectors.
               It was previously following the old Calo style from which the code was originally branched.

    - TPC10     -- Corrected parameter reading for dz_Readout which was incorrectly read as dz_Endplate,
                   which lead to a 75mm section of gas being placed behind the readout instead of infront.
                   Corrected copy number of cathode, was 1 in places and should have been 0.

    - ParticleGunGenerator -- Added Uniform Smearing for momentum over a defined interval, smearing values mean half the width.
                           -- Use /gun/momentumSmearingMode uniform


    - SHcalSc03 : changed to slightly rounded outer edges in the barrel to follow the engineering model (Sh.Lu)

    - the beamcal driver has been switched back to the new BeamCal08
    - a 1mm air gap has been added to the AHcal
    - switched back the treatment of MCParticles in the calorimeter to
      the old behavior, where parents of back scattered particles are stored...

    - implemented services for internal detectors in all three options of ILD models
    - changed thicknesses of Al beam pipe sections modeling services



===========================
LCIO: v02-01-02
===========================

    - fixed short print out of MCParticle
    - fixed warnings w/ unused variables (in function argument list)

GEAR: v01-02-02
===========================

     - new utility printMaterials to print material between two points
     - added some debug printout to testMaterialBudgetNew.cc



===========================

    New features (H.Hoelbe, DESY):
        - split reset ced into two parts: reset everything (shortcut R), reset view (shortcut r)
        - menu and popup menu expands now to left/top if right/button is not enough space.
        - update the manual (not finished yet)
        - Undo function is build in. (shortkey: 'u')
        - Replaced the GLUT popup menu by a selfmade main menu drawn at the top of the window and a selfmade context based popup menu.
          (The popup menu entrys depend on with object you click)
        - It is now possible to pick detector components
        - Marker which highlights the last picked object
            - Toggle this option in menu->graphics->picking marker. (Default option is off)

        Menus:
            - Popup/Main menu entrys now shown a little triangle at the right when they are have subitems
            - Add a menu option with allows to change the text size
            - Main menu now show current status of
                - axis visibility
                - layers
                - detector
                - transparency
                - projections
                - cuts
                - graphics settings
                - font size
                - fps

                - New available cut values for angle and z-cut added to popup and main menu
                - Selecting a detector component by righclick now allows to change its transparency (>,<), cutangle (m,M) and z-cut value (z,Z)
                - Selecting the background allows to change transparency, cutangle, z-cut value for all components starting at the individual values of each component
                - Save/Load now saves the individual values for each detector component

        - Add some of the normals to the draw detector function to improve lighting, still under construction!
        - Layer description text is now shown in popup menu


    Small changes (H. Hoelbe, DESY):
        - X,Y,Z-Axis now always get drawn at the point (0,0,0) (not obligatory at the center of the detector).
          I think this change will bring more overview when moving the detector and rotate it after this.

        - shortcut help frame now changes color depending on background color

        - It is now possible to decrease transparency by using the '<'-key to 0. (before it stops at an value of 0.05)
          (transparency of 0.0 is special because at this value only the outline of the detector will drawn)

        - In the DST viewer, a legend get drawn. Now the color of this legend will switch from white to black
          when the background color is to light. (white letters on white background was not readable)

        - Detector outline lines will now always set to no transparency. (default value in ced_config.h)

        - arrow keys moves the detector:
              arrow key left: z-axis,
              right arrow: -z-axis,
              up-arraw: y-axis,  (new)

        - fixed picking problem (calculate the distance for each method in the same way)
        - axis are now drawn always in the middle of the detector (enquired by frank)
        - subsubmenu and submenu are now able to draw horizontal lines
        - data and detector layer menus (main and popup) now shows the layer description
        - workaround for mac - draw bogus GLUT menu
        - Fixed bug in the picking line feature
        - Shortcut frame: now works correct for diverent font sizes
        - Popup menu now supports subitems

 - draw all tracks and clusters for recoparticles.



===========================
KalDet: v01-09
===========================

        - ild
          - Re-worked MaterialDataBase registerForService will need to be called at least once, 
            triggering initialisation from the gear manager, subsequent calls will check that the gear 
            managers are the same as those which was used to initialise. 
          - VXD support material added. 
          - Optimisation of Debug verbosity.



===========================
MarlinUtil: v01-05-03
===========================

    - fixed drawing of Hcal endcap (outer radius in gear file)
    - fixed uninitialised variables



===========================
MarlinReco: v01-02-01

    - added option to enable/disable output of root file containing histograms to BCalReco.cc (T.Tanabe)

    - fixed SIT parameters (new ZPlanarParameters )  in KinkFinder.cc (F.Gaede)

    - use streamlog for messages in EventShapes and SatoruJetFinder packages (T.Tanabe)

        - Correct pass by reference in argument list

      - MarlinTrkUtils
        - laced definition of finaliseLCIOTrack in header making it publicly available. 
        - Corrected track state at first and last hit.

      - Improved Diagnostics.



===========================
MarlinTrkProcessors: v01-06
===========================

  General:                       Removed use of sort predicate. Use sorted list of std pairs instead.
                                 Use _maxChi2PerHit in fits. 

  FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk:     Corrected uninitialised covariance matrix in combine tracks method.

  TruthTracker:                  Added new mode to fit tracks iteratively, off by default. Allow the 
                                 CED event display to be used during track creation.
                                 
                                 For the iterative mode split Tracks now have the individual segments
                                 added to a separate collection. 
                                 These segments are used to produce a combined track which uses the
                                 innermost and outermost segments to provided the track states at the IP,
                                 FirstHit, LastHit and Calo respectively. 
                                 The combined track is added to the main track collection, the NDF 
                                 and chi2 are set with the values from the innermost segment.
                                 The NDF and chi2 values for the other segments can be retrieved from
                                 the tracks added to the composite track.  
                                 
                                 Hits with no MCParticle are discarded.

  SiliconTracking_MarlinTrk:     Added protection against being overwhelmed by a very large number of
                                 hits within one sector. 
                                 The default is set to 100. For now an ERROR message is printed and 
                                 SkipEventException thrown. 
                                 This will be removed when the problem is more properly addressed.
                                 Make sure sort predicate for chi2 fulfils strict weak ordering.
                                 Fixed problem where using return instead of continue caused loss of all
                                 fitted tracks when single track fit failed.
                                 
  SpacePointBuilder:             Corrected SpacePoint creation bug. Endpoint of rear strip swapped 
                                 with endpoint of front strip. Added debug output for checking whether
                                 a strip is created from a real combination or ghost combination.



===========================
Clupatra: v00-07-01
===========================

    - added code to merge split tracks seeds - this happens sometimes if one link of a track seed
      is just a bit further than the current distance cut ( artefact of loops with increasing 
      distance cuts )

    - introduced parameter CosAlphaCut and merge hits from consecutive rows if
      their angle is smaller than acos(CosAlphaCut)
      -> helps to recover some stiff tracks in forward region   

    - added parameter NLoopForSeeding (default 4 )
      defining the number of loops for seeding with different distance cuts 

    - restrict segment merging to two segments at a time in order to
      prevent falsly merging almost complete tracks (through a small 'common' stub)
      - repeat this procedure once in order to get also tracks split into three 

    - use track state at first hit also for outward extrapolation as this is more 
      accurate when merging segments



===========================
LCFIPlus: v00-05
===========================

    - vertex-assisted jet clustering now adjustable with vertex pairing penalties
    - flavor tagging input variables added
    - can apply preselections to samples used in training



===========================
KiTrack: v01-02
===========================

    - Automaton: Added a counter of the connections between the segments



===========================
KiTrackMarlin: v01-02
===========================

    - Added FTDHelixFitter class, to fast fit a track with the HelixFit class from MarlinTrk



===========================
ForwardTracking: v01-05
===========================

      - TrackingFeedbackProcessor: 
         + Added output of theta and nHits of true tracks to root output (so one can plot efficiency over theta or nHits)

========================================

 New packages added in v01-13-06

========================================


 BBQ : v00-01-02 (M. Killenberg)

    BBQ is an event display for detailed TPC studies, based on TEve and ILCSoft. It can display the reconstructed tracks and 3D hits, as well as pulse information as projection onto the pads and in voxels (3D space bucktes). All pad planes currently available in GEAR are fully supported. 


 KiTrack & KiTrackMarlin (R. Glattauer):

    KiTrack: Contains algorithms for track finding and (abstract) base classes used by those algorithms. The two main algorithms are the Cellular Automaton and the Hopfield Neural Network.

    KiTrackMarlin: Implementation of the KiTrack base classes in the Marlin framework and some tools.

 Release notes from iLCSoft v01-13-05

=============================================

v01-13-05 is a developers release which includes mainly bug fixes for several issues found in the previous v01-13-XX releases concerning the visualization in Mokka. The QT version has been updated accordingly to take full advantage of the new QT based UI within Geant4.

The main changes in the tracking concern the addition of stereo strip hits for the SIT and FTD. SiliconTracking and FullLDCTracking have been modified accordingly to make use of this new functionality.

The CLHEP version has been updated in order to meet the geant4 recommendation (http://geant4.cern.ch/support/ReleaseNotes4.9.5.html#2.).

For further details, please check the ChangeLogs below.



========================================
 Updated versions of external tools
========================================

 Geant4: 9.5.p01

==============
KalDet: v01-07 
==============

    - ild
      - Added Strip Measurements for Segmented Disc Measurement Layers.
      - Added proper local coordinates for segments in ILDSegmentedDiscMeasLayer, so that it is no longer restricted to global X and Y.
          - Corrected getIntersectionAndCellID so that it returns the correct module ID, previously it was returning the Nth segment in the segmented disk, so
      - In ILDMeasurementSurfaceStoreFiller FTD now reads from GEAR parameters. Fixed counting problem for sensor. std::vector access out of range.
      - Renamed ILDParallelStripPlanarMeasLayer as ILDParallelPlanarStripMeasLayer.
      - Cleaned up use of cout and removed unnecessary includes.



=======================
Mokka: mokka-07-07-p07
=======================

    What is new in this Mokka release
    =================================

      I. New code that allows to smear the z-position of the vertex.

     II. Fixes on the visualization and GUI when building with cmake.

    III. Memory Leak fixes.

     IV. Overlap fix in Ecal Endcap Rings

    =================================

    Please note that:

       This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.5 and 9.4 (and 9.4.patch01) and
       CLHEP 2.1.0.1

       It was tested against GEAR v01-01 and LCIO v02-00-03, gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2,
       SL4 and SL5.

    =================================



=================
MarlinTrk: v01-05
=================

       - MarlinKalTestTrack:
         - Protect against initializing before any hits have been added.
         - Allow starting from strip hit in debug mode.

       - HelixTrack:
         - Take account of direction of helix for fit.

       - LCIOTrackPropagators:
         - Corrected phi range for propagation.



========================
 ForwardTracking: v01-02
========================

      - added finalising of tracks (final refit, radius of innermost hit, hitnumbers of detectors,... see method ForwardTracking::finaliseTrack )
      - modified fitting: now done in one central place by the class Fitter
      - changed initialisation of FTDTrack: now a MarlinTrkSystem* has to be passed, which can be used by the track to fit
      - Modified to use spacepoints
      - Added steering parameter: TakeBestVersionOfTrack
      - Added steering parameter for the best track subset
      - Use new gear params for FTD (getNSensors)
      - patched memory leaks
      - some renaming of classes and documentation


========================
 MarlinReco: v01-01-01
========================

    - bug fixes in Analysis/RecoMCTruthLink/src/RecoMCTruthLinker.cc:

        - The LCRelation Collections for TrackerHit to SimTrackerHits have been merged into a list of collections.
            Internally a single collection of LCRelations is created.
        - create track and cluster relations in any case as they are needed for the final recomctruth-link
        - converted exit to exception



===========================
MarlinTrkProcessors: v01-04
===========================

    SimplePlanarDigiProcessor:     When calling getLadderNumber the "ladderNumber" was given as input instead of the "layerNumber" (typo).
                   In getLadderNumber some hits were not assigned to the right layer due to rounding errors
                   (they got INT_MAX which caused an exception when writing it to the bit field). Introduced a (hard coded) 1 nm rounding
                   acceptance and all hits were found to be in their layer. In the case this should fail additionally put in that
                   the layer with the closest distance to the layer centre is returned.
                   Fixes from M. Killenberg
    
    SimplePlanarTestDigiProcessor: Updated to be able to work for all planar sub detectors, VXD, SIT, SET and FTD.
                   Will very likely supperseed SimplePlanarDigiProcessor in the next release.
    
    SiliconTracking_MarlinTrk &    Added Strip Hits for FTD.
    FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk:     FTD restored to track finding and fitting.
    
    
    RefitProcessor:        Updated to deal with recent addition of Strip Hits in FTD.
    
    TruthTracker:          Allow Helix parameters for fit to be take from MCParticle using UseMCParticleParametersFotInitOfFit == true.
                   Allow steering of values used for the initial diagonal elements of the trackfit via InitialTrackErrors.

    - Added new functionality for surfaces.
    Surfaces have a CoordinateSystem and may optionally be bounded.
    So far only Cartesian Coordinate System are available with rectangular and trapezoid boundaries.
    gearsurf remains in a separate directory and builds a separate library which is then linked to the gear library.
    All new functionality is included within the gear namespace.

=======================
Mokka: mokka-07-07-p06
=======================

 I. Implementation of services for inner detectors.
     New sub_detector tubeX06 is available, which uses the same driver as 
     tubeX05, but has a new DB, tubeX06_14. This DB contains sections made 
     of Al of different thicknesses to model the services that would go
     along the tube (only Al, and no Beryllium for those sections).
 II. Implementation of services for TPC and Ecal for models using SDHcal.
     New driver and sub-detector SServices_02_v00 are available for services 
     (cables, cooling) coming from TPC and Ecal, in the gap between barrel 
     and endcaps, in the model that uses SDHcal. 
III. Bug fix in step position of SDHcal endcaps.
     Thanks to Gerald Grenier and Ran Han, a fix is available for the 
     calculation of Z-coordinate of step position in SDHcal EndCaps.
 IV. Three new detector models were created
     Three new models are available, ILD_O(1,2,3)_v02, based on the _v01
     versions, where the tubeX05 is replaced by the new tubeX06 (mentionned
     above), and in the SDHcal model (ILD_O2_v02) the old services 
     sub_detector is replaced with the new one above (SServices_02_v00).
 V. Improved Si-Tracking drivers for ILD (Aplin, Glattauer)
    - SET_Simple_Planar, SIT_Simple_Planar and FTD_Simple_Staggered now write some
      additional gear parameters needed for reconstruction (strip angle, pitch, etc)
    - added separate hit collections for pixel and strip discs in the FTD_Simple_Staggered
    - added simplified sensor volumes to SIT and SET





================================
 MarlinReco: v01-01
===============================

   - RecoMCTruthLinker
      -  added mcTruthTrackLink: inverse relation from MCParticles to Tracks
         the weight will be the fraction of all sim-hits from the MCParticle
         that contributed to this track
      - changed weight definition for trackMCTruthLink:
        - weight is the fraction of all hits on the the track that have
          contributions from this MCParticle
        - computed as sumSimHits_from_this_MCParticle/total_number_of_hits_on_track
           -> weight can be large than 1.0 (if more than one hit from an MCParticle
              would be used in a given layer (delta ray))
           -> this definition of weights is more accurate for defining the 'fake hit rate'
              as (1.-weight) in the case of many merged sim hits for a given track
       - changed steering logic, such that it can be more easily called for
         certain sub-tasks, eg. Track-MCTruth-Link only:
       - made the following output collections optional:
         trackMCTruthLink, clusterMCTruthLink, RecoMCTruthLink, calo-hit MCTruthLink, skimmed MCParticle
         -> collections won't be created if empty name specified (default)
       - removed options:
         OutputClusterRelation, OutputCalohitRelation, OutputTrackRelation
         they are now also based on name empty/not empty
       - changed default for UseTrackerHitRelations to 'true'
          - print WARNING of set to false
         -- F.Gaede

   - LDCCaloDigi
        Implement use of LCIO calorimeter Hit step position for SDHCAL digitizer
        (multiplicity simulation) and add parameters to the processor to better
        control the digitization -- Gerald Grenier IPNL

    - TPCDigi
        Bug fix: added smearing of merged TPC hits
        (using rather large errors - which may have to be iterated on.)

     - BCalReconstruction
        Improved calibration (A.Rosca)

 
================
MarlinTrk v01-04

				General Cleanup and merger from changes from CLIC CDR. 				

  FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk:	Adapted to use composite Space-points composed from strip hits.
	
  SimplePlanarDigiProcessor:	Adapted to have option to produce strip hits.

  SpacePointBuilder:		New - Builds 3D composite Space-points from strip hits.


================
Clupatra v00-05 
================

      - reduce memory footprint: deal with one KalTest track at a time wherever possible
        (saves >2MByte/track)

      - properly set the bit UTIL::ILDTrkHitQualityBit::USED_IN_FIT
        for all trackerhits used in fit

 Release notes from iLCSoft v01-13-03

=============================================

v01-13-03 does not contain any changes made to the software other than a minor bug fix in the PathFinder package needed for compiling with newer gcc versions.

The major change in this release is the removal of the configuration packages (StandardConfig, MokkaDBConfig and LCFI_MokkaBasedNets) which
are, as of this release, decoupled from iLCSoft and merged into a separate configuration package called ILDConfig. The ILDConfig package will
be released separately and not necessarily in the same release cycles as iLCSoft.

 New packages added in v01-13-02

========================================


 PathFinder : v00-01-00 (I. Heinze)

    Pathfinder is a package which provides a track finding algorithm using Hough transformation and was written to find tracks in TPC prototype data.
    It takes hits (points in 3D space) as input and it can find straight tracks as well as helicoidal tracks.
    For more information see http://www-flc.desy.de/flc/flcwiki/PATHFINDER

                    less than 3 actually are included in the fit, by the kalman filter.

     SimpleCylinderDigiProcessor:   New - Uses simple gaussian smearing for cylinders.

     TruthTracker:          Fixed bug in SimTrackerHitSortPredicate.

================================
 MarlinTPC : v00-09-01
================================

Patch release

Additions:

+ Added PathFinder (hough trafo track finder project), including an example; will be installable also via ilcinstall
+ An interface processor to PathFinder
+ Added a new example with the reconstruction, up to track finding of the data acquired with the DESY GEM module

+ Added a new tool called TPCConditions2LCCD which will write in the condition database a TPCCondition object based on a text file provided by the user
+ Created a couple of new processor to elaborate the data at the raw level:
    RawDataCutterProcessor will shrink the effective time window of the raw data cutting from them all the pulses or part of those pulses that are coming some time after the maximum possible drift time. This value can be calculated by the processor using condition data or can be overridden by the user
    PedSubRawDataFilterProcessor is a conditional processor that will select an event based on the amount of pulses in an event and the average amplitude of these pulses. It can be useful to perform an event preselection based on these parameter or to subdivide the sample in two event classes to process with different algorithms (noise and data samples for example)
+ Added the RowCutApplicationProcessor developed by Martin Ljunggren from Lund to remove all the hits from a specific pad row

Changes:
o Added TrackerRawData to LCObjectCopier
o Several improvements and bug fixes in the digitisation:
o Moved theTrackerRawDatatoDataConverterProcessor to the general subfolder from the padbased subfolder
o Removed duplicate entry of ADD_MARLINTPC_LIBDIR( ./reconstruction/photoelectric ) from CMakeLists.txt file.
o GenericADCElectronicsParameters class:
o Added 2 bool values: PedestalSubstracted, ZeroSupressed. 
o Adjusted SignalDigitisationProcessor.cc to handle the modified class correctly.
o ADCElectronicsListener:
o Extended to handle the two new bool values of the GenericADCElectronicsParameters.
o PulseFinder upgraded to include overflow information after pedestal subtraction


Bug fixes
- added the value of cosine for track connection as a parameter in TrackMergerProcessor
- Fixed bug in a cast in the TPCConditionsListener.
- Small modification in the tool to convert the ALTRO Raw data file to LCIO which will store the version of the converter in the final file in the x.x.x format
- Corrected some typos in multiple processor documentations
- Modified the CMake file to solve a compilation problem caused by the reference to a tool not present in the repository
- added <algorithm> needed for gcc 4.4.3
- made reconstruction_curler and reconstruction_straight_tracks examples work again

For a full and detailed list of changes, refer to the log.

     =================================

       I. Improvements of the VXD driver

      II. New version of Analogue Hadron Calorimeter for ILD with Videau geometry 
          of the Barrel.

     III. Definition of a new development detector model

     =================================

     Please note that:

        This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.4 (and 9.4.patch01) and
        CLHEP 2.1.0.1

        It was tested against GEAR r386 and LCIO v02-00-pre00, gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2, 
        SL4 and SL5.

     =================================

       I. Improvements of the VXD driver

          Thanks to Georgios Gerasimos Voutsinas, we have now a new and more 
          realistic VXD implementation, following the description made by 
          Yasuhiro Sugimoto (details at 
          http://llr.in2p3.fr/~musat/VXD/YasuhiroSugimoto/VTX_design110823.pdf). 

          Currently only the inner part pf the VXD is improved.

          In the mokka steering file, this sub-detector can be switch on with
         
         /Mokka/init/subDetector vxd07


      II. New version of Analogue Hadron Calorimeter for ILD with Videau geometry 
          of the Barrel.

          the Barrel geometry suggested by Henri Videau. It has a new sensitive 
          detector for the 'A la Videau' barrel filled with scintillator sensitive 
          layers. The endCap and endCapRing are identical to SHcalSc03.

          In the mokka steering file, this sub-detector can be switch on with
         
         /Mokka/init/subDetector SHcalScV01

        * Outer line of detector are now smooth and are drawn at least to remove a grafical artifact
        * Add fading into the background color for bigger distance as a menu feature.
        * New order of popup menu items
        * Add some new shortcut keys
        * Add 4 extra slots to save user settings
        * fixed typo S for F and added brackets for ((a && b) || (c && d))  if condition
        * renamed MAX_LAYER to CED_MAX_LAYER in order to avoid name clashes with other tools (e.g. calice event display )



================================
 CEDViewer : v01-04
================================

    - Added option to supply limits to helix drawing, other than the extent of the TPC
    - Added option for drawing MC truth info for particle gun events
    - switched to TPC drawing with surfaces and cuts

    - adopted steering example steering files:
       - renamed ChannelMapperProcessor to ChannelMappingProcessor
       - changed raw data file pathes on afs

    - changed parameter DrawHelixForTrack to int:
       draw a helix for Track objects:
       0 none, 1: atIP, 2: atFirstHit, 3: atLastHit, 4: atCalorimeter

    - changes in DSTViewer processor:
      - code cleanup
      - use streamlog instead of cout
      - added parameter DrawDetectorID
      - this processor needs to be revisited ....

    - color code SimTrackerHits and SimCalorimeterHits by the MCParticle

    - added parameter MCParticleEnergyCut
    - fixed drawing of neutrals
         - neg. pz particles where drawn in wrong direction
         - start drawing particles at their vertex
    - added lightgrey color for neutrinos

    - added drawing of TrackerHitPlanae and TrackerHitZCylinder

    - added various color schemes for displaying particles, tracks and clusters
      -> steering parameter ColorScheme
    - print evt/run numbers at the end of the event

    - cmake changes:
        - added cmake policy CMP0008
        - removed obsolete install of header files



================================
 MarlinUtil : v01-05
================================

    - added drawing of the SET
    - added picking print funtions for TrackerHitPlane and TrackerHitZCylinder
    - changed drawing of SIT to 3D shape with surface
    - modified to match change of MAX_LAYER to CED_MAX_LAYER in ced_cli.h (requires CED 1.4)
    - added plannar SIT and protected against Gear exceptions for missing parameters



================================
 MarlinTrk : v01-01
================================

    - Support for KalDet Multilayer added
     - Added calo face to support detector
     - Made use of new method in  ILDVMeasLayer "getIntersectionAndCellID"
     - Change GetMLName to GetName in line with KalTest
     - Fixed phi range of helixtrack
     - MarlinKalTestTrack fixed definition of phi0 in  initialise(TS& ts)
       corrected conversion from LCIO to KalTest track parameters in initialise



================================
 MarlinReco : v01-00
================================

    - General
      - New release for preparation for the DBD.

    - Added hybridEcalSplitter (K. Kotera)

    - SiStripDigi: Processor to digitize and clusterize hits for the FTD subdtector
                       First release of the code, still missing full validation; (J. Duarte)

    - VTXDigiProcessor: corrected smearing to be along ladder, previously it was incorrectly perpendicular to the ladder,
                            due to the use of the ladders phi angle instead of it angle of inclination

    - FPCCDDigitizer: Fixed bug in helix approximation.- in previous version the intersection between particle and ladder
                          could be rotated to the opposite side.

        - RecoMCTruthLinker: Bug fix: protect against undefined mother pointer (T.Tanabe )
                 Modified to be able to use TrackerHit relations, though not yet the default.
                 Enable by setting UseTrackerHitRelations true in steering file

    - TPCDigiProcessor: Corrected problem where hits from alternative z halves could be considered to be adjacent
                Removed SimHits from RawHits and Used Relations. The deprecated feature to store them in the
                rawhits can be enabled by setting UseRawHitsToStoreSimhitPointer true.
